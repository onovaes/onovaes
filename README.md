I have a degree in **[Computer Engineering](https://blogdogabrielnovaes.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/diploma.pdf)** and I live in Campo Grande/MS :brazil:. In 2003, still at the University, doing an internship and developing my first codes with C++ and **PHP** with **MySQL**.

I currently work at [dothcom](https://www.dothcom.net) and most of the time I'm **reviewing *pull requests*** (mostly in php), automating processes, creating pipelines or training team members. I also really enjoy coding and I do it whenever I have time.

Along with my team I am also responsible for *Linux* servers working in high availability, serving more than 200 million page views of the [dothnews](https://www.dothnews.com.br) platform monthly.
